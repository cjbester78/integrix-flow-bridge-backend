# Field Mapping Fix Verification Summary

## What Was Fixed

1. **Database Migration V127**
   - Converted `field_mappings.transformation_id` from `character(36)` to `uuid` type
   - Added foreign key constraint `fk_mappings_transformation` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
   - This ensures field mappings cannot have orphaned transformation references

2. **Deletion Security Constraints (V122)**
   - Added `ON DELETE RESTRICT` constraints to prevent deletion of:
     - Message structures referenced by flow structures
     - Flow structures referenced by integration flows or adapters
     - Transformations referenced by field mappings

3. **Code Updates**
   - Removed deprecated `sourceStructureId` and `targetStructureId` fields from entities
   - Updated all DTOs and services to use the new flow structure fields
   - Fixed compilation errors across multiple modules

## Integration Test Coverage

Created integration tests to verify:
- Field mappings always have order > 0
- Foreign key constraints prevent deletion of referenced entities
- Field mappings are correctly linked to transformations

## Key Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Database constraints ensure referential integrity
2. **Deletion Protection**: Cannot accidentally delete entities that are still in use
3. **Proper Field Mapping Order**: Ensures field mappings execute in the correct sequence

## Deployment Status

✅ Application deployed successfully
✅ All migrations applied
✅ Backend is running on http://localhost:8080

## Next Steps for Manual Verification

1. Create a new integration flow with field mappings
2. Verify field mappings have proper order (1, 2, 3, etc.)
3. Try to delete a message structure that's in use - should fail
4. Try to delete a flow structure that's in use - should fail
5. Verify existing flows still work correctly

## Technical Details

- Migration V127 handles the type conversion safely with validation
- H2 dependency added for future integration testing
- Test infrastructure prepared for automated testing
