/**
 * Data Transfer Object for Adapter Configuration.
 * 
 * <p>This DTO represents the configuration for communication adapters in the integration platform.
 * It follows the REVERSED middleware convention where:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>SENDER</b> adapters receive data FROM external systems (but are considered OUTBOUND)</li>
 *   <li><b>RECEIVER</b> adapters send data TO external systems (but are considered INBOUND)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The adapter configuration includes both the adapter metadata and its specific
 * configuration stored as JSON for flexibility across different adapter types.</p>
