# Migration and Testing Results Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the testing results for the database migrations and code changes implemented to fix the missing data issues in the integration flows.

## Migrations Implemented

### V122__add_deletion_security_constraints.sql
**Purpose**: Add foreign key constraints with ON DELETE RESTRICT to prevent deletion of referenced entities.

**Test Method**: 
1. Load test data using `test_data_before_migration.sql`
2. Run `test_deletion_constraints.sql` to verify constraints work

**Expected Results**:
- Attempting to delete a message structure referenced by flow structures should fail
- Attempting to delete a flow structure referenced by adapters or integration flows should fail
- Deleting unreferenced structures should succeed

### V123__migrate_structure_references.sql
**Purpose**: Migrate data from deprecated `source_structure_id` and `target_structure_id` columns to new `source_flow_structure_id` and `target_flow_structure_id` columns.

**Test Method**:
1. Create integration flows with old structure columns populated
2. Run migration
3. Verify data is copied to new columns

**Expected Results**:
- Flows with only old columns should have data migrated to new columns
- Flows with both old and new columns should keep new column values
- Flows with only new columns should remain unchanged

### V124__fix_transformation_order_column.sql
**Purpose**: Rename `transformation_order` column to `execution_order` to match JPA entity mapping.

**Test Method**:
1. Check column exists as `transformation_order` before migration
2. Run migration
3. Verify column is renamed to `execution_order`

**Expected Results**:
- Column should be renamed successfully
- Default value should be set to 1
- Existing data should be preserved

### V125__fix_field_mapping_order.sql
**Purpose**: Fix field mappings that have `mapping_order = 0` by assigning sequential order numbers.

**Test Method**:
1. Create field mappings with order = 0
2. Run migration
3. Verify all mappings have order > 0

**Expected Results**:
- All field mappings should have sequential order numbers starting from 1
- Mappings should be ordered within each transformation

### V126__drop_deprecated_structure_columns.sql
**Purpose**: Drop deprecated columns after verifying all data is migrated.

**Test Method**:
1. Verify no data remains in deprecated columns
2. Run migration
3. Verify columns are dropped

**Expected Results**:
- Columns `source_structure_id` and `target_structure_id` should be removed
- No data loss should occur

## Code Changes

### FlowStructureService
- Added deletion validation to check for references before deleting
- Checks integration flows and adapters using the flow structure

### MessageStructureService  
- Added deletion validation to check for flow structures using the message
- Uses repository method to count references

### FlowCompositionService
- Updated to use new flow structure fields
- Sets `mappingOrder` when creating field mappings
- Removed references to deprecated fields

### IntegrationFlowRepository
- Added methods to count flows by source/target flow structure IDs

## Test Execution Steps

1. **Setup Test Database**
   ```bash
   psql -U your_user -d integrixflowbridge_test -f test_data_before_migration.sql
   ```

2. **Run Migrations**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   # Or manually run Flyway migrations
   ```

3. **Verify Results**
   ```bash
   psql -U your_user -d integrixflowbridge_test -f verify_migration_results.sql
   ```

4. **Test Deletion Constraints**
   ```bash
   psql -U your_user -d integrixflowbridge_test -f test_deletion_constraints.sql
   ```

## Test Results Summary

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Compilation | âœ… PASS | All modules compile without errors |
| Structure Migration | ðŸ”„ PENDING | Requires database testing |
| Column Rename | ðŸ”„ PENDING | Requires database testing |
| Field Mapping Order | ðŸ”„ PENDING | Requires database testing |
| Deletion Constraints | ðŸ”„ PENDING | Requires database testing |
| Deprecated Column Removal | ðŸ”„ PENDING | Requires database testing |

## Known Issues

1. **Unit Tests**: Complex unit tests have compilation issues due to many mocked dependencies. Integration tests would be more appropriate.

2. **Test Coverage**: Current tests focus on database migrations. Additional tests needed for:
   - API endpoint testing
   - Full integration flow creation
   - Field mapping visual editor

## Recommendations

1. **Before Production Deployment**:
   - Backup production database
   - Test migrations on staging environment
   - Verify no active flows use deprecated columns
   - Run migrations during maintenance window

2. **Post-Migration Verification**:
   - Run verification queries
   - Test creating new integration flows
   - Verify existing flows still work
   - Check field mapping order in UI

3. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Keep database backup before migration
   - Migrations V122-V125 can be manually reversed
   - V126 requires restoring columns from backup

## Conclusion

The migrations and code changes address the root causes of the missing data:
1. Schema mismatch between `transformation_order` and `execution_order`
2. Incomplete migration from old to new structure columns
3. Missing order assignment in field mappings
4. Lack of referential integrity constraints

These changes ensure data integrity and prevent similar issues in the future.
